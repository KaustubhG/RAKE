Over the past two decades recombinant proteins have gained increasing importance for therapeutic
applications, and the number of proteins either approved or launched into clinical trials has continually
increased over this period. Stable gene expression (SGE) is the most widely used technology for the
production of recombinant proteins by mammalian cells. Transposon systems mediate stable integration of
exogenous DNA elements into a host cell genome, and have been successfully used in mammalian cells for
the generation of stable cell lines. Here, the piggyBac (PB) transposon system has been used to facilitate the
genomic integration during a stable transfection. The aim was to optimize the generation of stable pools and
clones using the piggyBac transposon system. In particular, the reduction of the selection duration for
generation of stable pools and co-integration of multiple transgenes was studied. Work was also done for
understanding the limitations of the piggyBac transposon system in terms of amount of coding DNA. The
results show that, unlike the conventional transfections, using transposition, a selection time frame of 5 days
is sufficient to generate cell pools that are stable for up to 6 weeks after a single gene transfection. The
integration efficiency of the piggyBac transposon system is emphasized by the fact that transposon-based
transfections show only a reduction of 40 % in recombinant protein productivity even if a thousand times less
coding DNA was transfected. The experiments conducted with the co-integration of multiple genes shows
that the piggyBac transposon system provides an efficient method for the co-integration of multiple genes up
to 4 genes. Our results allow us to conclude that the productivity of the pools and clones generated by PB
transposition is several folds higher than the productivity of clones obtained by standard transfection.
