The aim of this project is to investigate ligand binding sites and modes of ligand binding for the
Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) family of proteins. DHFR is important for DNA synthesis as it
reduces dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). DHFR is responsible for the levels of
tetrahydrofolate in a cell, and the inhibition of DHFR can limit the growth and proliferation of cells
that are characteristic of cancer. DHFR can be target in the treatment of cancer. Synthetic ligands as
methotrexate (MTX), aminopterin (AMP) and their analogues act as potential competitive inhibitor.
They do so by mimicking the coenzyme dihydrofolic acid (DHFA) and thus inhibit the activity of
DHFR antagonistically. Hence our aim was to perform a Structural Analysis of binding site of
MTX and ligands similar to MTX on DHFR. This would help us in elucidating the subtle
differences in the binding of the antifolate drug to DHFR enzymes in various organisms and
especially help us understand the binding to human DHFR and possible reasons for toxic effects.
To begin with we constructed a non-redundant dataset of DHFRs from the PDB database. The
different DHFRs were analysed for their Structural Classification of Protein (SCOP) folds and also
ligands bound to the protein complex. SCOP folds were determined for the unclassified entries.
The PDBs of our interest belong to the Enzyme Classification (EC) No: 1.5.1.3 and contain
Dihydrofolate reductase like fold. The structural analysis of binding sites of DHFR with MTX (or
ligands similar to MTX- Tanimoto coefficient > 0.70) was performed. PDBs analysed were: 1DF7
(DHFR bound to MTX), 3DFR (DHFR bound to MTX), 3DL5 (DHFR bound to DHF), 3IA4
(DHFR bound to MTX).
Multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW yielded poor sequence similarity as ClustalW
performs a global alignment. Pairwise sequence alignment using BLAST2seq gave a good identity
score between different pairs. Further, structure based sequence alignment was carried out using the
following softwares: DaliLite- pairwise structure based sequence alignment and Mustang - multiple
structure based sequence alignment. Results obtained reflected an excellent alignment with a Z-
score > 20 and low RMSD.
The Ligand protein interactions were investigated using LigPlots from PDBSum and Ligand Protein
Contacts (LPC) database. This helps in determining the residues that play an important role in the
interactions between the protein and the ligand. The PocketSuite algorithms, PocketMatch and
PocketAlign were used to perform structural comparisons of the binding sites consisting of DHFR
bound to MTX/DHF. The PocketMatch Scores were above 0.6 for all the pairs of inputs. This
shows a high match between the binding sites. PocketAlign results reflected low total RMSD
scores, showing an excellent superimposition between different sets of selected binding sites. The
interacting residues obtained from LigPlots were compared with the conserved residues obtained
from MUSTANG. Positive results reflect evolutionarily conserved residues. These might be either
functionally or structurally conserved residues. In future, a comparison of the binding sites of
human DHFR with that from other organisms can help us in selectively designing molecular
inhibitors that can act as an antifolate.
