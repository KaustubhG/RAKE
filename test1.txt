Small molecules that bind genomic DNA have proven that they can be effective
anticancer, antibiotic and antiviral therapeutic agents that affect the well-being of
millions of people worldwide. DNA is the pharmacological target of many of the drugs
that are currently in clinical use or in advanced clinical trials. Targeting DNA to regulate
cell functions by modulating gene expression or by interfering with replication seems
logical, intuitively appealing and conceptually straightforward. With the new wealth of
information provided by the Human Genome Project, it was expected that this
information would lead to a quantum leap in the development of DNA binding
pharmaceuticals since this information should facilitate the elucidation of the roles that
different genes play in important pathological processes. But the present scenario is not
according to what was expected. Presently DNA comprise only 1% of the known drug
targets. The reason for this is the lack in specificity and the drug delivery issues. In order
to overcome these issues researches in increasing the specifity and overcoming the
delivery issues are being carried out in different parats of the world. The present work
tries to deal with the first issue in some respect. Intercalators are small molecules that is
inserted into DNA between a pair of base pairs and has been found to be the most
effective anti-cancer agents. But despite its importance, the issue related to its specifity
and lack of information regarding the detailed mechanistic of this process, has hindered
in their use as the therapeutic drugs. The advancements in the computer aided drug
design has opened a new gate for the research in this direction. Though many groups are
working on the intercalation, nobody has yet fully solved the problem of the docking in
the intercalation site of B-DNA. In order to solve this problem and also to develop an
understanding of the mechanism, an effort has been made.
