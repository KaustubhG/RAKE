In this work, we investigated two types of biomolecular interactions. The first involves enzyme-
substrate reactions and the second involves electron transfer properties of redox probes in the
biological medium of milk. Alkaline Phosphatase, Urease, Glucose Oxidase and Esterase
enzymes were adsorbed to Carboxylic acid terminated (3-Mercapto Benzoic acid) Self-
Assembled Monolayer (SAM) modified gold electrodes and investigated using Impedance
Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and reaction with respective enzyme substrates.
Enzyme Kinetics was studied by allowing the adsorbed enzymes to react with different
concentrations of its substrates and following the reaction using impedance spectroscopy and
single frequency impedance analysis in real time. Impedance changes at various substrate
concentrations have been found to follow Michelis-Menten kinetics.
Electron transfer properties of four different redox systems in homogenized bovine milk studied
using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy shows that milk incredibly sustains the
redox reactions in the absence of a supporting electrolyte and the peak currents are comparable
to those obtained when the same reactions were carried out in standard solvent preparations of
the redox systems. Shifts in half peak potentials, decrease in diffusion coefficient values and
impedance parameter differences are discussed in relevance to the structures of various
components in milk. The study shows that electrochemical studies can be carried out directly in
biological components
