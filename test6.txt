In this work, we investigated protein adsorption on two types of Self-Assembled Monolayers
(SAMs). Amino terminated (4-Amino Thiophenol) and Carboxylic acid terminated (3-Mercapto
Benzoic acid) were used to form the SAMs. The adsorption of the enzyme Calf Intestine
Alkaline Phosphatase was investigated using Impedance Spectroscopy and adsorption was
confirmed using Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and
reaction with para-nitro phenyl phosphate (p-NPP). Single frequency impedance values were
obtained and analyzed for various protein concentrations in different buffers and pH. Impedance
changes have been found to follow Langmuir Adsorption kinetics. Enzyme Kinetics was studied
by allowing the adsorbed enzyme to react with different concentrations of its substrate and
following the reaction using impedance spectroscopy and single frequency impedance analysis in
real time. Impedance changes at various substrate concentrations have been found to follow
Michelis-Menten kinetics.
