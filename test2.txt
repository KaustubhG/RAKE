Hydroxyapatite is one of the calcium phosphate based bioceramic material
that has attracted widespread interest from both orthopedic and dental fields due to its excellent
biocompatibility and bioactivity coming from the analogy to the mineral components of natural
bones. Hydroxyapatite fine powders have been successfully produced by a sol-emulsion-gel
method by varying the concentration of a non-ionic surfactant in the organic phases (oil phase)
of water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. A distilled water solution of calcium acetate and 2-butanol
solution of phosphorous pentoxide were used as starting precursor. Hydroxyapatite gel powders
with 2, 4 and 5 volume% of surfactant (Span 80) in cyclohexane were developed and calcined at
different temperatures up to 1000 o C. Characterization of the powders was done using XRD and
TEM. Pellets were made from the developed HAP powders and tested for its biocompatibility
after immersion in the simulated body fluid.
